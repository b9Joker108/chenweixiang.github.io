# Commands

Syntax:

```
brew --version
brew <command> [--verbose|-v] [options] [formula] ...
```

Show Homebrew and system configuration info useful for debugging:

```
brew config
```

Fetch the newest version of Homebrew and all formulae from
GitHub using *git* and perform any necessary migrations:

```
brew update
```

List all installed formulae:

```
brew list
brew list --version
```

Perform a substring search of cask tokens and formula names for *text*.
If *text* is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression.
The search for *text* is extended online to homebrew/core and homebrew/cask.
If no search term is provided, all locally available formulae are listed.

```
brew search [text|/text/]
```

Install *formula*:

```
brew install <formula>
```

Display brief statistics for your Homebrew installation. If a formula or cask is
provided, show summary of information about it:

```

brew abv [formula]
```

Upgrade *formula*:

```
brew upgrade <formula>
```

Uninstall *formula*:

```
brew uninstall <formula>
```

Check your system for potential problems. Will exit with a non-zero status
if any potential problems are found:

```
brew doctor [--list-checks] [--audit-debug] [diagnostic_check ...]
```

Uninstall formulae that were only installed as a dependency of another
formula and are now no longer needed:

```
brew autoremove [--dry-run]
```

Remove stale lock files and outdated downloads for all formulae and casks,
and remove old versions of installed formulae. 

```
brew cleanup [options] [formula|cask ...]
```
